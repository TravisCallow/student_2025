                        <li>In summary, this class has been an incredible journey where I've gained valuable new skills and applied them to my projects. I've learned how back-end development works, including creating my own APIs and managing databases. One of my proudest accomplishments is building a custom quiz system that rewards users with XP and levels, combining both functionality and creativity. This course has challenged me to push my limits, turning frustration into perseverance and broken code into breakthroughs. While there may have been a few tears along the way, I've come out stronger, not only as a coder but as someone who strives to be the best in everything I do. I've conquered this course, and this is only the beginning of my coding journey.</li>

                    <li>Throughout this class, I've gained a much deeper understanding of back-end development, including how APIs and databases work together to create dynamic web applications. These skills will be extremely valuable for future projects, helping me build more advanced and interactive websites.</li>
                    <li>Looking forward, I plan to expand this website by implementing user-created quizzes, where users can design their own study sets. Along with this, I want to add a leaderboard system that tracks top-scoring users, making studying more engaging and competitive for everyone.</li>
                    <li>One of my biggest goals is to use the coding skills I've learned to develop unique games that stand out in the industry. I want to combine my creativity with technology to create fun, immersive experiences that people will enjoy playing.</li>
                    <li>In the future, I plan to start my own company that sells customizable products online. My vision is to create a website where customers can design their own items with personalized features, giving them the freedom to create products that are truly one of a kind.</li>
