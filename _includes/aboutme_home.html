                            <p>This picture is important to me due to several reaons. The primary reason is because it contains
                                the two things I love more than most things. These two things are football and my cat. My cat means
                                a lot to me because of how cute and sweet he is. Football is how I get rid of my stress and anger.
                                Football is very fun and I love it.

                            <p>This picture is important in two main reasons. The main reason is because of my faith. The other reason
                                is because this was during a beach camp my church had. This camp was a very fun time for me, especially
                                because all I was doing during summer was football practice and nothing else.
