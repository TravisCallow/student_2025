For 3.6, I didn't see that it said to select 2 answers so I only selected one, but the one I selected was correct. 3.15, I am not used to making a coinflip simulation like the one stated, I like to tell the user what they got each flip with a loop rather than simulating it like that and my brain was too tired to make an accurate calculation I guess which resulted in me not getting the correct answer. 1.17, I didn't read the answers fully so I didn't see that there are multiple answers. 3.18 got me confused because I thought computers are very accurate. 4.1, I don't know too much about the Internet Protocol Version stuff. 4.2, I've always sucked at networking, when I was in Cyber Aegis I couldn't even get 2 points on the Packet Tracer in an entire hour, networking is way too confusing to me still.</li></ul>

I should have put more work into the test and I should've done the test when I was in the right mindset rather than zoning out every 5 seconds and not being able to concentrate on a question. Overall, I should study more, get in a good mood, and thoroughly read the questions and answers so that I can achieve the highest score possible because I know I am able to do it, I just need to be in the right mindset.</li>
